# Food recipe
Food is an important part of our life. With the rise of technology, many people now use 

websites and social media to find and share recipes. Also, Filipino dishes are not 

always easy to find online in one organized place. This inspired our group to create a 

website called Foodie Faves, a simple and easy-to-use site that shares various Filipino 

food recipes.

Foodie Faves is a basic website made using HTML and CSS. It is designed to 

showcase popular Filipino dishes. The site includes three main sections: Home, Menu, 

and About. Each recipe has its own page so users can easily follow the instructions.

The website is static, which means all content is fixed and does not change. It does 

not include advanced features like user login or comments. It only uses HTML and 

CSS, and all recipes are pre-packed manually.

This project helps promote Filipino culture through food. It also helps our group 

improve our skills in basic web development. Most importantly, it gives users a fun and 

easy way to learn how to cook Filipino dishes
